name: Memory Server
shortDescription: Persistent knowledge graph storage with entities, relations, and observations
description: |
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a persistent knowledge graph system for storing and managing interconnected information. It enables AI assistants to create structured memory of conversations, facts, and relationships.

  ## Features

  - **Entity Management**: Create and manage primary nodes representing people, organizations, events, or concepts with observational data
  - **Relationship Mapping**: Establish and maintain directed connections between entities describing interactions and associations
  - **Observations Storage**: Store discrete, atomic facts attached to entities for precise information retrieval
  - **Graph Querying**: Search and retrieve entities by name, type, or observation content
  - **Graph Navigation**: Open specific nodes to explore their interconnections and related entities
  - **Persistent Storage**: Automatically save knowledge graph to JSONL file for reliable persistence across sessions

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Optional:**
  - **Memory File Path**: Configure custom storage location for knowledge graph (defaults to memory.jsonl in server directory)

toolPreview:
  - name: create_entities
    description: Create new entities in the knowledge graph. Entities are primary nodes representing people, organizations, events, or concepts. Each entity can have a type and initial observations.
    params:
      entities: Array of entity objects with name, type (optional), and observations (optional)
  - name: create_relations
    description: Establish connections between entities in the knowledge graph. Relations describe interactions, associations, or relationships in active voice from source to target entity.
    params:
      relations: Array of relation objects with from (source entity name), relation_type, to (target entity name), and observations (optional)
  - name: add_observations
    description: Add discrete facts or observations to existing entities. Observations should be atomic, containing one fact each, for precise information storage and retrieval.
    params:
      entity_name: Name of the entity to add observations to
      observations: Array of observation strings to add
  - name: delete_entities
    description: Remove entities from the knowledge graph. Deleting an entity will cascade delete all associated relations and observations.
    params:
      entity_names: Array of entity names to delete
  - name: delete_observations
    description: Remove specific observations from entities in the knowledge graph.
    params:
      entity_name: Name of the entity
      observation_indices: Array of indices of observations to delete
  - name: delete_relations
    description: Remove specific relations between entities in the knowledge graph.
    params:
      relation_ids: Array of relation IDs to delete
  - name: read_graph
    description: Retrieve the complete knowledge graph. Returns all entities, relations, and observations stored in the system.
    params: {}
  - name: search_nodes
    description: Query entities by name, type, or observation content. Useful for finding relevant information in the knowledge graph based on keywords or patterns.
    params:
      query: Search query string to match against entity names, types, or observations
  - name: open_nodes
    description: Fetch specific entities and their interconnections. Returns detailed information about an entity including its observations and related entities through relations.
    params:
      names: Array of entity names to retrieve with their connections
