  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Salesforce integration, providing comprehensive CRM management capabilities through the Salesforce API.

  ## Features

  - **Multi-Object Support**: Work with standard and custom objects

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Salesforce Connected App**: You'll need to create a Connected App in Salesforce and get the client credentials

  ### How to create a Connected App and get your credentials:

  1. **Create a new Salesforce External Client App**
     - Log in to your Salesforce portal
     - Go to Setup, and then search for 'External Client App Manager'
     - Select 'New External Client App' from the top right
     - Enter `Salesforce` as the External Client App Name
     - Fill in a Contact Email for your Salesforce Administrator
     - Set 'Distribution State' to 'Local' from the dropdown menu
     - (Optionally) Fill in the other fields
     - Click the `Create` button

  2. **Configure OAuth Settings**
     - Expand the 'Api (Enable OAuth Settings)' section, and check the box to Enable OAuth
     - Enter your callback url. Any url will work, as we will only use the client id and secret to authenticate.
     - Check on "Enable Client Credentials Flow".
     - In the 'App Settings' section
       - Select the `Manage user data via APIs (api)` and `Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)` OAuth Scopes from the list
     - Click the 'Create' button

  3. **Register your OAuth App credentials**
     - Go to Your app's settings page. Under the "Policy" -> "Oauth policy" section, click "Edit".
     - Check on "Enable Client Credentials Flow". Put an username that you want to run as the user with client credentials.
     - From the 'Settings' tab for your External Client App
       - Expand the 'OAuth Settings' box and then click 'Consumer Key and Secret' from inside the 'App Settings' block
     - Save the consumer key and secret as you will use them later.

  4. **Find your Salesforce domain**
     - Go to "Setup"
     - in "Quick Find" search for "My Domain"
     - Click on "My Domain". Find the domain in "Current My Domain URL". Use the one before salesforce.com. For example, if the url is https://mydomain.devloping.my.salesforce.com, the domain is mydomain.devloping.my.
     - Copy the domain and save it for later.

  5. **Environment Variables**
     - Set `SFDC_CLIENT_ID` to your Consumer Key
     - Set `SFDC_CLIENT_SECRET` to your Consumer Secret
     - Set `SFDC_DOMAIN` to your Salesforce domain (for example, mydomain.devloping.my)
